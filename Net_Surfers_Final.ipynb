    "Online shopping is getting more and more popular these days. Online stores like Amazon ship millions of orders everyday. Online stores these days have a review section so we can review the products we buy. What we want to find out is, if these reviews influence a buyer to get or not get a product. We also want to project to see if by looking at the reviews we can determine where the product is placed by the ranking in terms of sales. We will only be looking at the books section on amazon since there are millions and millions of reviews and products on amazon."

We will use Pandas Library to clean the data and sklearn to do the data analysis. The data will be run on the personal computer, but if the data gets too big, we would need UH Manoa HPC or another server provider to run the data and maybe other resources to run code on that data faster"
